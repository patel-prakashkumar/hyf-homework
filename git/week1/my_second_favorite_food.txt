Ingredients
200g brown basmati rice
1 tbsp olive oil
1 butternut squash, diced
1 red onion, diced
2 tbsp mild curry paste
300ml vegetable stock
4 large tomatoes, roughly chopped
400g can chickpeas, rinsed and drained
3 tbsp fat-free Greek yogurt
small handful coriander, chopped
Method
STEP 1
Cook the rice in boiling salted water, as per pack instructions. Meanwhile, heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook the butternut squash for 2-3 mins until lightly browned. Add the onion and the curry paste and fry for 3-4 mins more.

STEP 2
Pour over the stock, then cover and simmer for 15-20 mins, or until the squash is tender. Add the tomatoes and chickpeas, then gently cook for 3-4 mins, until the tomatoes slightly soften.

STEP 3
Take off the heat and stir through the yogurt and coriander. Serve with the rice and some wholemeal chapattis if you like.
